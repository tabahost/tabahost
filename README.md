 *  *  Some important thing: It's fundamental to say that no reverse engineering was
 *  *  used to develop this server. We used the so called "French Caffe" techique, as SAMBA
 *  *  project, and no source code was provided by either iEN or Russian FreeHost Team. It
 *  *  was built from scratch with only some theorical contributions from Itmo to create the
 *  *  server main loop (at beginning of project, since I had never created a server before)
 *  *  and lots of book reading.
